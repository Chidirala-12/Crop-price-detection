Hi all, This is a Crop Price detection model using machine learning techinques. The prediction is done using Three regression techniques Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression and Decision Tree Regression.
The steps involed are as follows:
Explorative Data analysis : In this step the data is collected and the various features of data are identified. The columns of the data set are identified. The information involved in data, datatypes involved in data. The null values, unique values of the data are identified. And colinearity is identified and similar column data are converted into single column while training the model. In this model Costcultivation and costcultivation2 are colinea, so by using sctter plot technique this identification is done and by using feature engineering making new colum costcultivaton_p which is product of both to handle.
Data Visualisation and tranformation: For normal distribution plotted histograms, applied logs transformation for not normally distributed and boxplots for outliers detection. 
Data splitting : The data set is splitted into two parts testing and training sets. In this X is for features and Y for target set.
Model Selection, Training and evaluation: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression and Decision Tree Regression are used to train the model and evaluted. The evalution also involves R2 scores and mean square errors.
